    "text": "Random forests are a popular supervised machine learning algorithm.\nRandom forests are for supervised machine learning, where there is a labeled target variable. Random forests can be used for solving regression (numeric target variable) and classification (categorical target variable) problems. Random forests are an ensemble method, meaning they combine predictions from other models. Each of the smaller models in the random forest ensemble is a decision tree.\nImagine you have a complex problem to solve, and you gather a group of experts from different fields to provide their input. Each expert provides their opinion based on their expertise and experience. Then, the experts would vote to arrive at a final decision.\nIn a random forest classification, multiple decision trees are created using different random subsets of the data and features. Each decision tree is like an expert, providing its opinion on how to classify the data. Predictions are made by calculating the prediction for each decision tree, then taking the most popular result. (For regression, predictions use an averaging technique instead.)\nThe Dataset: This dataset consists of direct marketing campaigns by a Portuguese banking institution using phone calls.

    "text": "Probability theory, a branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of random phenomena. The outcome of a random event cannot be determined before it occurs, but it may be any one of several possible outcomes. The actual outcome is considered to be determined by chance.\nA random variable is a variable whose value is unknown or a function that assigns values to each of an experiment’s outcomes. Random variables are often designated by letters and can be classified as discrete, which are variables that have specific values, or continuous, which are variables that can have any values within a continuous range.\nLet’s take an example of the coin flips. We’ll start with flipping a coin and finding out the probability. We’ll use H for ‘heads’ and T for ‘tails’. So now we flip our coin 100 times, and we want to answer some questions. What is the probability of getting heads over these 100 times? Will the probability change when we flip from 1 time to 100 times?\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef simulate_coin_flips(num_flips):\n    outcomes = np.random.choice(['Heads', 'Tails'], size=num_flips)\n    head_count = np.cumsum(outcomes == 'Heads')\n    probabilities = head_count / np.arange(1, num_flips + 1)\n    return probabilities\n\ndef plot_probability_change(probabilities):\n    plt.plot(probabilities)\n    plt.title('Probability of Getting Heads over 100 Coin Flips')\n    plt.xlabel('Number of Flips')\n    plt.ylabel('Probability')\n    plt.axhline(0.5, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Expected Probability (0.5)')\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.show()\n\n# Simulate coin flips and plot the results\nnum_flips = 1000\nprobabilities = simulate_coin_flips(num_flips)\nplot_probability_change(probabilities)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: flip coins\n\n\n\n\nBased on the above figure Figure 1, we can find that at the early stage, the probability of getting heads may be 0.3, 0.6 or something else. However, when we flip coins for more and more times, the probability will be converged to about the expected probability 0.5.\nThen next question we want to explore is that: What if we do some tricks to make the head side of coin heavier than the tail side of coin? In this case, let us assume head side of coin is 7 grams while the tail side is 3 grams.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef simulate_coin_flips(num_flips):\n    outcomes = np.random.choice(['Heads', 'Tails'], size=num_flips,p=[0.7,0.3])\n    head_count = np.cumsum(outcomes == 'Heads')\n    probabilities = head_count / np.arange(1, num_flips + 1)\n    return probabilities\n\ndef plot_probability_change(probabilities):\n    plt.plot(probabilities)\n    plt.title('Probability of Getting Heads over 100 Coin Flips')\n    plt.xlabel('Number of Flips')\n    plt.ylabel('Probability')\n    plt.axhline(0.7, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Expected Probability (0.5)')\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.show()\n\n# Simulate coin flips and plot the results\nnum_flips = 3000\nprobabilities = simulate_coin_flips(num_flips)\nplot_probability_change(probabilities)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: flip coins\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we can find that at the early stage, the probability of getting heads may be something random. However, when we flip coins for more and more times, the probability will be converged to about the expected probability 0.7."
